  In close collaboration with divisions throughout RENCI, the OOD develops organizational capabilities, oversees strategic sustainability planning, and supports current and future research and development. To bolster RENCI’s continued growth, the OOD also focuses on improving internal operations and processes, supporting staff in professional development efforts, and growing a collaborative, inclusive culture. 

  A priority for the OOD is amplifying the work happening at RENCI. The OOD is responsible for reporting RENCI achievements to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR) and to the RENCI Oversight Board, which consists of the VCRs and Provosts from UNC-CH, Duke, and NC State. Members of the OOD also regularly make presentations about RENCI’s work to organizational collaborators, funding agencies, and state and national government.
