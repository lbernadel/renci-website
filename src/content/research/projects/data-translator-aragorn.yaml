  Biological knowledge is increasingly standardized and made available through simple programming interfaces.  But how can scientists best consume that information, and use it to enhance their research?  ARAGORN (Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks) is a tool that knows how to assembles information relevant to a user query, and uses that information to synthesize well-supported answers.   ARAGORN is a component of the [link to: NCATS Data Translator], and is the evolution of the [link to: ROBOKOP] knowledge-graph– based question- answering system.

  RENCI leads the Ranking Agent team, one of six Automated Relay Agent teams within the [Biomedical Data Translator project](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator). This team has produced a tool called ARAGORN, which answers user-specified biomedical questions by reasoning over a federated knowledge -graph, applying on-the-fly ranking to produce the most accurate results quickly. 

  ARAGORN attempts to bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. ARAGORN uses elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, cluster and combine answers with similar content, and reveal the commonalities and contradictions in answers. As development continues, the project will formulate and validate new graph-based methodologies for determining the best answers to user-asked questions.
