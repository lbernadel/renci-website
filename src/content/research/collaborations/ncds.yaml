  RENCI played a lead role in establishing the NCDS in 2012 and is one of the founding members. We continue to lead and contribute to a variety of NCDS programs and initiatives:

  - NCDS Career Events provide exposure and opportunities for students of all degree levels to Data Analytics and Data Science careers.   
  - The [Data Matters](/projects/data-matters) Short Course Series helps scientists, business managers, and government officials better understand the field of data science and provides practical skills to apply in their organizations.
  - The Data Economy is collaboration with the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology and Innovation to understand and support the role of Data Science in driving economic development.
